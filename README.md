# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a Movie Recommendation System. The system uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past ratings.
Project Summary

The Movie Recommendation System is a project designed to suggest movies to users based on their previous ratings using collaborative filtering techniques. It processes movie data, trains a recommendation model, and generates personalized movie recommendations. The system is implemented in Python and includes data preprocessing, model training, and a recommendation engine.

 # Use of the Project
- **Personalized Movie Suggestions**: Users receive movie recommendations tailored to their tastes.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Helps streaming platforms and movie databases improve user engagement.
- **Educational Tool**: Demonstrates collaborative filtering techniques and recommendation system implementation.


## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a recommendation model using collaborative filtering.
- **Recommendation**: Provides movie recommendations for a given user.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `models/`: Stores the serialized models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for the application and recommendation engine.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the source code.
- `demo.mp4`: Video demonstration of the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YashPise/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Run the `Movie-recommender-system.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` folder to preprocess the data and save the models.

2. **Model Training**:
    - The model training is done within the notebook. Make sure to run all cells to train and save the model.

3. **Generate Recommendations**:
    - Run the `app.py` script in the `src` folder to start the recommendation engine.
    ```sh
    python src/app.py
    ```
